Clone Hero (v0.22.5) does not apply tap-off until the next tick.
So we move each tap-off earlier by one tick.
(Moonscraper doesn't have this issue, so CH must be using an old version?)

2020-10-26: CH v0.24.0.2068-master also now has this bug with SP phrases...

2022-01-27: CH v1.0.0.4080 appears to not have it with SP. But still on taps.
Also, Moonscraper v1.5.0 is the same.

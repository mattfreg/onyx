    loading-phrase: Here it is, my biggest charting project to date. One month went
      into the making of this monsterous chart. I would like to give a big thank you
      to TFG85, because without them, this project wouldn't be done yet. They helped
      out so much, with charting and giving feedback. Also, shoutout to Ardebitis
      for the tempo map. Hope you all enjoy this as much as we did making it.
